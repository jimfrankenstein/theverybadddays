    <p class="pb-5"><span class="highlight">The Very Bad Days</span> are a childishly grim B-horror flick of a rock band; a poignant, unexpectedly sweet, and fucking hilarious dive into punk existential Ghostbustery.</p>

    <p class="pb-5">They proudly brew a dark yet playful blend of indie originals and revisionist punk covers that tease the creepiness out of otherwise innocent yesteryear favorites. Whimsical accounts of socially anxious demons. 90’s pop saudade. Emotional eulogies for real dolphin suicide. There's no shortage of terrible, horrible, no good very bad days to sing about.</p>

    <p class="pb-5">Whether as an acoustic coffee shop conversation or a crashing electric boomfest in a downtown Minneapolis brewpub, seeing the Very Bad Days is a strange, shared experience—like sighting an alien in your backyard. You’re spooked, baffled, violated, surprisingly amused. You want to run, but you’re captivated by the sudden and overwhelming comfort that despite the emptiness and levity of this world, you are not alone.</p>
